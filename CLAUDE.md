Build a simple 2D endless runner game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The theme should blend Metallica and Minecraft styles.

Game Concept:
- The player controls a pixelated Metallica band member running through a Minecraft-like landscape.
- The objective is to avoid obstacles like creepers, TNT, and lava pits while collecting guitars and musical notes for bonus points.
- The character should jump, slide, and maybe perform a power chord attack (optional).
- Include a dynamic score counter and increasing speed as the game progresses.
- Use pixel art for characters and background, with a heavy-metal-inspired soundtrack loop (can be chiptune).
- Provide basic collision detection, game over screen, and restart functionality.

Keep the game logic in a single JavaScript file (e.g., `game.js`). Use simple key controls (like arrow keys or spacebar). No external libraries required, but clean modular code is appreciated.
